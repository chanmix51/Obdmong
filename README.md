Obdmong
=======

This is a light Object Model Manager over MongoDB. In fact it adds very few to the existing php Mongo classes: the ability to get PHP objects defined and yet schemaless from MongoDB queries.

For now it is not tested, nor documented and the author is very grumpy to have to code that instead of being able to use an existing lib that would just do this.
